In this mini project, I've learned the basics of React applications and how to create a Vite application. Moreover, I've learned about the famous web framework Express and gained knowledge in Node.js. In the backend, I've initialized a jokes array variable in index.js file containing three joke objects. In the frontend, within App.jsx, I've fetched jokes through a specific URL, learning to connect the backend and frontend. I've also explored different functions and variables, including Axios for API calls and proxy configuration for handling backend requests in development.
