# Mini Project: Full Stack Web Application

## Overview

This mini project was a fun way to get my feet wet with full-stack web development using React, Vite, Express, and Node.js. The main aim was to learn about HTTP servers and see how easily React and Express can be used together.

## Frontend

- **React:** Played around with React to build a simple frontend and see how intuitive it is.
- **Vite:** Tried out Vite for its quick setup and speedy development.
- **Axios:** Used Axios to fetch data from the backend.
- **Proxy Configuration:** Set up a proxy in the development environment to make backend requests work smoothly.

## Backend

- **Express:** Set up a basic backend using Express.
- **Node.js:** Used Node.js to run the backend.
- **Jokes Array:** Created a simple `jokes` array in the `index.js` file with three joke objects for fun.

## Connecting Frontend and Backend

- Fetched jokes from the backend to connect the frontend and backend.
- Learned how to manage data and ensure everything works well together.
