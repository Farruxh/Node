# Mini Project: Full Stack Web Application

## Overview

This mini project demonstrates my learning journey in creating a full-stack web application using React, Vite, Express, and Node.js.

## Frontend

- **React:** Built the frontend using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite:** Utilized Vite for setting up the React application, benefiting from its fast development and build capabilities.
- **Axios:** Used Axios to make API calls, facilitating communication between the frontend and backend.
- **Proxy Configuration:** Configured a proxy in the development environment to handle backend requests seamlessly.

## Backend

- **Express:** Developed the backend with Express, a robust web framework for Node.js.
- **Node.js:** Gained knowledge in Node.js, which served as the runtime environment for the backend.
- **Jokes Array:** Initialized a `jokes` array variable in the `index.js` file, containing three joke objects.

## Connecting Frontend and Backend

- Fetched jokes from the backend through a specific URL, integrating the two parts of the application.
- Explored various functions and variables to handle data and ensure smooth communication between the frontend and backend.

This project has provided a solid foundation in full-stack development, enhancing my understanding of how different technologies work together to create a complete web application.
